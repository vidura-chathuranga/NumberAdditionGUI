# NumberAdditionGUI
This program will add two numbers and show the result in a Window. I wrote this code for Practicing SWING in JAVA


If you want to Run This download and extract this file, So open the project folder and inside that you can find a dist folder, inside that there will be a application called MyApplication.jar. So you have to copy that file path and copy it into ur CMD and run like this. Follow My command below
java -jar "C:\Users\VIDURA\OneDrive\Documents\NetBeansProjects\MathApplication\dist\MathApplication.jar"

You must have to include your JAR file path in the double quotes
